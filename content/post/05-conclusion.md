Partisan's design choices assume a lowest-common-denominator strategy: these optimizations should be beneficial for any of the major distributed actor systems: Distributed Erlang, Scala's Akka, or Microsoft's Orleans.  However, if you're using Erlang or Elixir, you can take advantage of Partisan immediately using our library-based reference implementation available on GitHub!
